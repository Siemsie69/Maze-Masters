Hii Hello, Dear Reader,

I'm thrilled to introduce my Maze generator to you, offering up to four different scale levels and designed with four distinct themes. 
In this game, your challenge is to navigate out of the maze before the timer runs out. 

Please understand that while the website isn't responsive, it was created as part of a school project. 
As part of the assignment, I had to incorporate a random element and a timer. I'm still in the learning phase of development. 

Give it a try and enjoy the adventure!

Warm regards,

Mr. Siemsie
